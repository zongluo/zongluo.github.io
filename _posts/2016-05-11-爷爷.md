Under the wide and starry sky,

Dig the grave and let me lie.

Glad did I live and gladly die,

And I laid me down with a will.

This be the verse you grave for me;

Here he lies where he longed to be,

Home is the sailor, home from sea,

And the hunter home from the hill.

—斯蒂文森《安魂曲》

爷爷去世三年了。三年来，我很少想到他，正如他生前，我也很少想到他一样。

今年7月2日，是爷爷三周年祭日。家里人从各地赶回老家祭拜。我作为长孙，不能缺席。

从北京出发，坐了一夜车。早上先到家里与爸妈汇合，然后乘车到了300多公里外的奶奶家——一个爷爷奶奶生活了大半生的小村庄。那里依旧地广人稀，而且日渐凋敝。我们到时，人们大多先到了，亲人相见，自有一番亲热。好酒好菜排了上来。我却不合时宜地想：不是回来上坟么，何以竟先热闹起来了。

第二日无话。

第三天是正日子。大家早早出发。爷爷的坟在村外，不远，和太奶奶的挨在一起。据说位置是爷爷当年自己挑的，当时周围是片荒地，如今已长满了庄稼，此时是盛夏，满眼碧绿，一望无垠。几百米外有片树林，树木青翠挺拔。再过两三月，就能看到“碧云天，黄叶地”的景色了，很令人陶醉。

站在爷爷坟前，我想起了鲁迅先生的话，他在《写在“坟”后面》一文中说到：

> 我只很确切地知道一个终点，就是：坟。然而这是大家都知道的，无需谁指引。问题是在从此到那的道路。那当然不止一条，我可正不知哪一条好，虽然至今有时也还在寻求。

此刻，望着那隆起的黄土堆，想到爷爷在这地下长眠。这生与死的永别让我害怕。我想，是的，“我可正不知哪一条好”。

我小的时候，过年都和爷爷奶奶在一起，每年只有这一次机会相处。有一次分别的时候，爷爷让我回家之后每个月给他写一封信，一年12封。他说：“收到第12封，你就要来了。” 爷爷从未收到我的一封信，我无法想象他当时失望的表情。那时我还小，甚至分不清“爷”和“斧”的写法，我也没把这件事当作一件郑重的承诺。现在无论我多用心地写，爷爷都看不到了。

不觉间，思绪像打湿的纸，被悲伤一点一点染透。

三年前的那个下午，我刚从海淀图书馆看书出来，接到爸爸的电话，知道了爷爷去世的消息。当时天气炙热如火，我心里却冰凉刺骨。不知为什么，我第一位倾吐的对象是一个远隔重洋的美国朋友。我几乎是被本能驱使着，用英语一口气记录下了我当时的心情。思绪凌乱，不能自已。现在一并附在下面吧。

愿我的爷爷安息。

> In my memory, since I was very small, my grandfather had been working all day long, farming, cooking, doing everything to raise the big family, even when I was at his house, I could only see him when we ate together, he was out otherwise working.  He was one of the very typical Chinese farmers on this land. 

He was kind to me and always asked me to write him letters though he couldn't read, I was too small at first and even didn't know how to write "grandfather" in Chinese. Later on, I could but I never did it, now there would be no chance for me to do it. I think, subconsciously, I never cherished his love for me, not only did I not write to him, but I didn't talk to him much. He was not educated and I went to school, so I thought there was nothing in common between us. Now at this very time, I know it doesn't matter what I talk or write to him, what does matter is the fact that I write or talk to him.  

His image is quite blur to me, I couldn't recall the stories between us. This makes me feel bad. 

He had been falling in bed for two years, the disease was torturing him so bad because he couldn't talk, couldn't move, and he couldn't read, so he had nothing to do except sitting in bed and waiting for The Day to come. He was upset with the disease and the trouble he brought to the family. 

I feel so sorry that I didn't do anything for him during this period, I didn't take care of him ardently and instinctually felt alien to him because he was so poor due to the disease.  
On the phone, my father told me that everybody( my grandparents have seven children, three sons, four daughters, my father ranks the second. ) felt a relief, they have been having a hard time too these years, now they can take a rest.  Everything has been taken care of, my grandfather has been buried—my aunts wouldn't let him incinerated.  

My grandfather was nobody, nothing glorious in his life. He passed away without leaving anything except us, his offsprings. He never owned a cellphone, never used computers, never had a chance to go outside of the village to take a look at the rapidly changing world.   

He is not religious, I have no idea where he would go afterlife, anyhow, he won't have a heavily loaded life anymore and I wish he could be at peace. 

Goodbye, grandpa.
